# On-the-go Reflectance Transformation Imaging with Ordinary Smartphones

> Based on the paper of the same name[^1] from Mara Pistellato and Filippo Bergamasco.

Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is a technique to capture the reflectance of an object under different lighting conditions. It enables the interactive relighting of the subject from any direction and the mathematical enhancement of its surface shape and color attributes.
